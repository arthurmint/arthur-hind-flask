<h1>Superposition</h1>
<p>The superposition analysis technique can help make a circuit with multiple voltage and current 
    sources, by focusing on one source at a time and removing the others. Voltage sources can be
    replaced by a short-circuit, and current sources are open-circuited as they have infinite
    internal resistance. When trying to find a certain value and each source has been analysed, the 
    value in each scenario can be added together to give the correct value.</p>
<h2>Example 1</h2>
<p>Consider the following circuit consisting two voltage sources and a current source.
    Suppose, we are trying to find the current through R1.
</p>
<b>Image goes here</b>
<p>Firstly, let's focus on the 5V Voltage, redrawing the circuit by open-circuiting the current
    source and short-circuiting the 9V source.
</p>

<p>The current through R1, in this case, can be determined using Ohm's Law.
    $$I = \frac V R$$ $$I = \frac V {R_1 + R_2}$$ $$I = \frac 5 {3 + 1}$$ 
    $$ I = \frac 54 = 1.25 \space A$$ Now, let's consider the 9V source, 
    repeating the same process and redrawing the circuit.
</p>
<b>Image goes here</b>
<p>In this case, a smiliar calculation can be carried out with I flowing in the same direction.
    $$I = \frac V {R_1 + R_2}$$ $$I = \frac 9 {3+1}$$ $$I = \frac 9 4 = 2.25 \space A$$ 
    Finally, let's look at the 1A current source. This time, short-circuiting the voltage sources
    and redrawing the circuit to show this:
</p>
<b>Image goes here</b>
<p>In this case, we have a simple current divider. The formula for this is $$I = I_S \times \frac {R_2} {R_1 + R_2}$$
    $$I = - 1 \times \frac 1 4$$ $$ I = - 0.25 \space A$$ Note the minus sign indicating the current flow
    opposes that of the I drawn.<br>Now, these values can be summed to find the current through R1 in the 
    original circuit: $$I = 1.25 + 2.25 - 0.25 = 3.25 \space A$$
